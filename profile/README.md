## Proposal

Paradoxically, it has become an era where individuality is as important as uniformity. Our team came up with a solution that meets the needs of both distinctiveness.

First, Custom House enables users to group individual home appliances according to their preference. This means that you can operate numerous grouped products in a single trigger. Using this application, users can design their own routines; For instance, washing machines and stylers can be paired up as a routine to accomplish the assigned task. 

Second, AI technology has brought a drastic change into this world. Precisely analyzing and predicting data have always been strong traits of AI. Custom house will analyze age, gender, and household using scikit-learn which is a free machine learning Library for python to accurately recommend routines accordingly to their category. This service will find uniqueness from the immense dataset. 

In conclusion, users will have an easier life if they use recommended routines and routines that initiate numerous home appliances. Additionally, users can accomplish tasks as simply and quickly as possible by using AI speakers.
